## Hi, I'm Jene Choi!

I'm a CS master's student at USC, passionate about building projects and solving problems. <br />
My experience spans across fullstack development with React, Typescript and Python.<br />
In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to intern at Splunk in San Jose, where I worked as a full-stack software engineer. <br />
I am continuing my journey as a full-stack software engineer intern at NVIDIA from January to April! :D<br />
