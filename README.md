## Hi, I'm Jene Choi!

After graduating from USC and UCLA, I began developing tools for AV engineers as a Software Engineer at NVIDIA. 
My work primarily involves Python and Golang, with a focus on OpenTelemetry, where Iâ€™ve gained in-depth expertise.

I love cats, coffee, reading sci-fi books, and painting.
Happy to chat!
